Simple stock dashboard App using the Alpha Vantage API and ApexCharts to visualise the data.

The App is modified to use LOCAL data with the fetch API as the free use of Alpha Vantage API is **limited** to **5 requests per minute**.

You can use an external API source by modifying the app.js

This is **not realtime stock data.**  
I just created this **for educational purposes only.**
